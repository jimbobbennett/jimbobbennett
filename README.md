🥱 **Longer bio**

Jim is head of developer advocacy at Pieces for Developers, focusing on enabling developers to be more productive by leveraging contextual awareness of not only the code they write, but the content the read and the conversations they have. He’s British, so sounds way smarter than he actually is, and lives in the Pacific North West of the USA. In the past he’s lived in 4 continents working as a developer in the mobile, desktop, and scientific space. He's spoken at conferences and events all around the globe, organised meetup groups and communities, and written books on mobile development and IoT.

He also hates and is allergic to cats, but has an 11-year-old who loves cats, so he has 2 cats.
